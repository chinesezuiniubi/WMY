The paper provides two parts of key code, namely the key code of attention image erasure and joint loss function code.

Attention image erasure code needs to use the CAM algorithm to calculate the thermal map in advance, and use the thermal map and the original map to calculate to generate the local area image. The joint loss function code provides the code of Lvfl and Center loss. The specific implementation method can refer to the paper.
